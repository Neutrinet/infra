# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
node.name: {{ inventory_hostname }}
#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
#
path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearch
#
# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
#
# Path to directory where to store snapshots
#
path.repo:
  - /var/lib/elasticsearch/snapshots
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
#
#bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# By default Elasticsearch is only accessible on localhost. Set a different
# address here to expose this node on the network:
#
network.host: _local_
#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Ensure that your node does not inadvertently connect to other clusters that
# might be running on your network.
#
discovery.type: single-node
#
# For more information, consult the discovery and cluster formation module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Various -----------------------------------
#
# Require explicit names when deleting indices:
#
#action.destructive_requires_name: true
#
# Tickets above this size (articles + attachments + metadata)
# may fail to be properly indexed (Default: 100mb).
#
# When Zammad sends tickets to Elasticsearch for indexing,
# it bundles together all the data on each individual ticket
# and issues a single HTTP request for it.
# Payloads exceeding this threshold will be truncated.
#
# Performance may suffer if it is set too high.
http.max_content_length: 400mb
#
# Allows the engine to generate larger (more complex) search queries.
# Elasticsearch will raise an error or deprecation notice if this value is too low,
# but setting it too high can overload system resources (Default: 1024).
#
# Available in version 6.6+ only.
indices.query.bool.max_clause_count: 2000
#
# ---------------------------------- Security ----------------------------------
#
#                                 *** WARNING ***
#
# Elasticsearch security features are not enabled by default.
# These features are free, but require configuration changes to enable them.
# This means that users donâ€™t have to provide credentials and can get full access
# to the cluster. Network connections are also not encrypted.
#
# To protect your data, we strongly encourage you to enable the Elasticsearch security features.
# Refer to the following documentation for instructions.
#
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.16/configuring-stack-security.html
