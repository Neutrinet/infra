# Read metrics from the bare metal servers via IPMI
[[inputs.ipmi_sensor]]
  ## Setting 'use_sudo' to true will make use of sudo to run ipmitool.
  ## Sudo must be configured to allow the telegraf user to run ipmitool
  ## without a password.
  # use_sudo = false

  ## Recommended: use metric 'interval' that is a multiple of 'timeout' to avoid
  ## gaps or overlap in pulled data
  interval = "40s"

  ## Timeout for the ipmitool command to complete
  timeout = "20s"

  ## Schema Version: (Optional, defaults to version 1)
  metric_version = 2

  ## If ipmitool should use a cache
  ## for me ipmitool runs about 2 to 10 times faster with cache enabled on HP G10 servers (when using ubuntu20.04)
  ## the cache file may not work well for you if some sensors come up late
  # use_cache = false

  ## Path to the ipmitools cache file (defaults to OS temp dir)
  ## The provided path must exist and must be writable
  # cache_path = ""

# Read metrics from storage devices supporting S.M.A.R.T.

  ## On most platforms used cli utilities requires root access.
  ## Setting 'use_sudo' to true will make use of sudo to run smartctl or nvme-cli.

# Monitor disks' temperatures using hddtemp
[[inputs.hddtemp]]
  ## By default, telegraf gathers temps data from all disks detected by the

  ## Only collect temps from the selected disks.

  ## A * as the device name will return the temperature values of all disks.
