  # When a new group of alerts is created by an incoming alert, wait at

  # This way ensures that you get multiple alerts for the same group that start
  # firing shortly after another are batched together on the first
  # notification.

  # When the first notification was sent, wait 'group_interval' to send a batch

  # resend them.
